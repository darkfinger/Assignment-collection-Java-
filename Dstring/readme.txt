1.	Please save the program with the name ‘Dstring.java’
Write a program that reads a string from the keyboard. 
If the length of the string is an even number, your program should split the string into two strings of equal length. 
If the length of the string is odd, your program should split the string into two strings where the first part has 
one more character than the second part. Your program should output the two strings it created. 

For example: 
	Input: 		2BeOrNotToBe
	Output:		2BeOrN	
				otToBe

	Input:			ToBeOrNotToBe
	Output:	          ToBeOrN
				otToBe
