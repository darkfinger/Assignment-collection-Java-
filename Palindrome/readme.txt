Write a method  which return true if the string parameter is a palindrome.
A palindrome is any "word" which is the same forward and backward, eg, "radar", "noon", "20011002", ... 
The function should return false if the argument is not a palindrome. 
Please try to use functions that we have learned in class.
example: 
	abc is not a palindrome.
	noon is a palindrome .
